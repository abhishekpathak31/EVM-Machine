# EVM-Machine
An IOT (Internet Of Things) Project Using Microcontroller


Hardware Description:-
•	PIC 16C77Microcontroller
•	Push Buttons 
•	Transistors
•	Transformers
•	Voltage regulator
•	LCD (16x2 Display)
•	LED
•	Resistors



Software Used:-
1.  Micro C PRO for PIC
2.  Proteus Hardware Simulation Software


FUTURE SCOPE OF WORK
•	A timer could be included, which could automatically end the voting after specified duration of time.
•	Biometric Verification of voters, so that automatically insured that one person is voting only once.
•	It can be made more interactive by adding sound effect (speech) to it.
