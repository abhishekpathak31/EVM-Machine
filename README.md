# EVM-Machine
An IOT (Internet Of Things) Project Using Microcontroller


Hardware Description:-

1.  PIC 16C77Microcontroller
2.  Push Buttons 
3.  Transistors
4.  Transformers
5.  Voltage regulator
6.  LCD (16x2 Display)
7.  LED
8.  Resistors



Software Used:-
1.  Micro C PRO for PIC
2.  Proteus Hardware Simulation Software


FUTURE SCOPE OF WORK:-

1.  A timer could be included, which could automatically end the voting after specified duration of time.
2.  Biometric Verification of voters, so that automatically insured that one person is voting only once.
3.  It can be made more interactive by adding sound effect (speech) to it.
